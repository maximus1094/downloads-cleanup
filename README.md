# Downloads Cleanup
Python script which simply cleans up your 'Downloads' folder.

### Prerequsities
- `Python 3`
- Messy Downloads folder.

### Usage
- Download `cleanup.py` file.
- Place the file in your Downloads folder if it isn't already.
- Run it.

### Results
All files in your Downloads folder will be organized into following folders: <br />
`Audio, Video, Images, Documents, Folders, Compressed, Executable, Other` <br />
and you'll have an easier time looking for whatever you need, or deleting certain types of files in bulk.

### Contributing
One of the simplest things you can do to contribute is to open `Other` folder created by the script after running it, examine which types of files weren't accounted for, and modify the script to deal with that type of file.
